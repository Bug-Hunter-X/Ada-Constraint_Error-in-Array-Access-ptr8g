# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: the `Constraint_Error` exception that arises from accessing an array element outside its defined bounds.

The `bug.ada` file contains Ada code that attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds. The `bugSolution.ada` file provides a corrected version with robust exception handling.

This example highlights the importance of careful index checking and appropriate exception handling in Ada to prevent runtime errors and ensure program stability.  Ada's strong typing and exception handling features provide mechanisms to prevent and manage such errors effectively.
